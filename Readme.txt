unpackJPG v2.5h (12/07/2013)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

packJPG is a compression program specially designed for further
compression of JPEG images without causing any further loss. Typically
it reduces the file size of a JPEG file by 20%.

unpackJPG is a decompression only, BSD licensed variant of packJPG. If 
the LGPL is too strict for usage in your own software project and you 
still want to include packJPG decompression functionality in your 
project, you may use the unpackJPG source code.

packJPG is the result of countless hours of research and development. It
is part of my final year project for Hochschule Aalen.

Prof. Dr. Gerhard Seelmann from Hochschule Aalen supported my
development of packJPG with his extensive knowledge in the field of data
compression. Without his advice, packJPG would not be possible.

The official developer blog for packJPG is hosted by encode.ru.

packJPG logo and icon are designed by Michael Kaufmann.
